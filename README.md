üìã About The Project
Aura is an agentic AI chatbot designed to act as a first point of contact for individuals seeking to talk about their well-being. The core of the application is an intelligent agent that first classifies the user's initial statement into one of three categories: General, Emergency, or Mental Health.

If the issue is General, Aura provides a standard disclaimer and recommends consulting a doctor.

If it's an Emergency, Aura gives immediate instructions to contact emergency services.

If it's a Mental Health concern, Aura transitions into a caring, conversational companion, offering an empathetic ear, asking gentle questions, and providing safe, general coping strategies and resources.

This project serves as a practical example of building stateful, agentic applications using modern AI tools.

‚ú® Features
